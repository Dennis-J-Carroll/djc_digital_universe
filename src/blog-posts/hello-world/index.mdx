# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post on this new website. This post will introduce you to the site and its features.

## About This Site

This website is built with Gatsby and uses MDX for content. It showcases various aspects of my work:

- Data Science Projects
- Project Development
- Creative Writing
- And more!

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div className="greeting">
      <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Greeting;
```

## What's Next?

In future posts, I'll be sharing:

- Tutorials on data science techniques
- Insights from my development projects
- Creative writing pieces
- Updates on new features of this site

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
