# Sample Data Science Project

This is a sample data science project showcasing how MDX content will be displayed on your website.

## Project Overview

In this project, we'll explore how to analyze a dataset using Python and TensorFlow.

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample code
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Clean data
    data = data.dropna()
    # Normalize features
    data = (data - data.mean()) / data.std()
    return data
```

## Interactive Components

When you build your site, you can embed interactive components here, like Jupyter notebook visualizations or interactive charts.
