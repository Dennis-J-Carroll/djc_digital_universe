PLACEHOLDER DIRECTORY - OG IMAGES NEEDED

This directory needs 1200x630px PNG images for Open Graph social sharing:

Required files:
- og-default.png (site-wide fallback)
- og-home.png (homepage)
- og-projects.png (development projects page)
- og-stories.png (stories page)
- og-about.png (about page)

See README.md for detailed specifications and design guidelines.

The SEO component currently references these images. Until they are created,
the meta tags will point to non-existent files. This won't break the site,
but social sharing previews won't display images.

Recommended tools:
- Canva (free templates)
- Figma (professional design)
- Photoshop/Illustrator

Color scheme to match:
- Primary: #14b8a6 (teal)
- Secondary: #06b6d4 (cyan)
- Background: #0a0e14 to #1a1f2c (dark gradient)
