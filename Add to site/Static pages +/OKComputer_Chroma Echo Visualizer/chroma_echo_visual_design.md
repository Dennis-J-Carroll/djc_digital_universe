# Chroma Echo Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A sleek, immersive, and futuristic visual style that mirrors the core of Chroma Echo. The aesthetic draws inspiration from the minimalist interfaces of sci-fi films like 'Arrival' and the sophisticated, dark-mode elegance of high-end creative software like Adobe After Effects. The design aims to be a digital sanctuary, focusing on contrast and luminosity to make the interactive color formations the hero of the experience.

### Content Density

Medium density. Each slide focuses on 1-3 key points, allowing for large, immersive visuals to dominate. This approach prioritizes visual impact and conceptual clarity, with generous dark space (20%-25%) to enhance the sense of focus and sophistication, mirroring the minimalist nature of the Chroma Echo canvas.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #0A0A0F (Deep space black - creating immersive canvas)
- Primary color: #4ECDC4 (Electric cyan - main interactive elements)
- Secondary color: #556F7A (Slate gray - supporting elements and structure)
- Accent color: #FF6B6B (Vibrant coral - highlights and call-to-action elements)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #2C2C2C
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #F0F2F2

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Hedvig Letters Sans (Unique, characterful sans-serif that provides a modern, distinctive brand feel - for main titles)
  - Jersey 15 (Blocky, structured font with a digital, grid-based feel for technical or data-heavy headings - for technical emphasis)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (Clean, elegant sans-serif with excellent readability for body text - primary body text)
  - Coda (Rounded and friendly font that brings an organic, approachable feel - supporting text and captions)

## 4. Image Style

Abstract and conceptual. Utilize macro photography of luminous materials like bioluminescent organisms, flowing liquids with high contrast lighting, or intricate light refractions. Graphics should be minimalist, featuring thin glowing lines and subtle gradients on dark backgrounds, emulating the aesthetic of high-end tech product visuals or modern art installations.
